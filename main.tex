\section{Introduction}

I have seen it many times: a disgruntled student loudly expressing their frustration about a written assignment, only for the old and wise teacher to explain why the text \textit{has} to be dry.

What is the purpose of scientific writing?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item record information
    \item share information
    \label{share}
    \item strive for objectivity
    \label{objectivity}
\end{enumerate}

Arguments against the current standard of scientific writing:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item it does not achieve \ref{objectivity}
    \item it does a bad job of \ref{share}
    \item it hides important metadata
    \item it is non-inclusive
    \item it is too constrained (videos, interactives, etc)
\end{enumerate}
